This is a [Vintage Story](https://vintagestory.at) mod. It adds a stirling engine, made out of clay and a copper plate. It can convert fuel into modest amounts of mechanical power, without needing either flax or wind.

It features an animated 3D model by [@corfidbizna](https://github.com/corfidbizna/), of a stirling engine design that (sort of) works in real life.
